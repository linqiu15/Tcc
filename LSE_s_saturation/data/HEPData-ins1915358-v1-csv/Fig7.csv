#: description: Background-subtracted distributions for the multiplicity of tracks reconstructed in the vertex detector for $T_{cc}^+\to D^0 D^0 \pi^+$ signal, low-mass $D^0\bar{D}^0$ and $D^0D^0$ pairs. The binning scheme is chosen to have an approximately uniform distribution for $D^0\bar{D}^0$ pairs. The distributions for the $D^0\bar{D}^0$ and $D^0D^0$ pairs are normalised to the same yields as the $T_{cc}^+\to D^0 D^0 \pi^+$ signal. For better visualisation, the points are slightly displaced from the bin centres. Uncertainties on the data points are statistical only and represent one standard deviation, calculated as a sum in quadrature of the assigned weights from the background-subtraction procedure.
